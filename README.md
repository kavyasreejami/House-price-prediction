Linear regression can be used to establish a relationship between features of a house (like size, bedrooms, location) and its selling price. This creates a model that approximates the price based on the features.

The Process:
Data Collection: You'll need a dataset containing house information (features) and their corresponding selling prices.
Feature Selection: Choose the most relevant features that might influence price. This could be square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, age of the house, and location.
Model Training: Train the linear regression model using the data. This involves finding a straight line that best fits the data points (house features vs prices).
Prediction: Once trained, you can use the model to predict the price of a new house by providing its features. The model will estimate the price based on the learned relationship.

Important Points:

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between features and price. In reality, the relationship might be more complex.
The accuracy of the prediction depends on the quality of your data and chosen features.
This is a simple approach, and for better accuracy, more sophisticated machine learning models might be needed.
